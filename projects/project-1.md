The Smart Campus Energy Lab, or SCEL, strives to create a meteorological sensor platform
throughout the University of Hawaii at Manoa, while utilizing renewable energy source
devices that are both cost-efficient and self-sustaining. These SCEL weatherboxes allow the
collection of weather data to determine optimal locations around the campus at UHM. 

As the Dashboard team, our primary objective is to obtain the meteorological data sent by
SCELâ€™s weatherboxes and display it in an accessible user interface (i.e. UI) via graphical and
numerical representations. Further, the purpose of creating this UI is to pull and grab data from
the SCEL server, update and manipulate the data accordingly, and organize that data through
simple navigation on the Dashboard UI. The foundations of this Dashboard stems from learning
web development languages, which we needed to self-teach ourselves throughout the semester.
