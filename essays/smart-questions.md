When we were younger, there was a saying that "stupid questions" never existed. Quite frankly, I think we all know
that statement is false. Questions that are "not smart" do exist in this world, and it's especially notable in the 
realm of programming. Programmers -- regardless of how much experience they have -- will always ask questions, always look for
answers. However, according to Eric Raymond's **["How to Ask Questions"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)**,
the satisfaction received from these answers depends on just how "smart" the question poses itself. 

## The Satisfaction of Smart Questions

Generally, when we ask questions, it's because we don't know the answer -- so we look to the experts for help. For programming,
we look to the more experienced programmers ("hackers", as what Raymond calls himself and others among the same level of expertise) for 
our solutions. Raymond refers to "answering a good question" as a stimuli and a gift. Besides Google, 
StackOverflow is home to many of our programming answers, where if we ask, we shall receive.
