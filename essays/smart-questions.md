When we were younger, we were told that there is no such thing as a "stupid question" -- which is true (to some extent). What we 
consider a "stupid question" is nothing more than just an ill-informed, poorly-constructed question that can be worded to a higher degree
of intelligence. This is especially notable in the realm of programming. Programmers -- regardless of how much experience they have --
will always ask questions, always look for answers. However, according to Eric Raymond's **["How to Ask Questions"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)**,
the satisfaction received from these answers depends on just how "smart" the question poses itself. 

## The Satisfaction of Smart Questions

Generally, when we ask questions, it's because we don't know the answer -- so we look to the experts for help. For programming,
we look to the more experienced programmers ("hackers", as what Raymond calls himself and others among the same level of expertise) for 
our solutions. Raymond refers to "answering a good question" as a stimuli and a gift. In other words, if the question is 
thought-provoking, insightful, clearly looking to understand the concept behind the code, it will be received in a good light and the
answers that come out of it are satisfactory. Questions that can be answered merely by a Google search, or where the asker is clearly 
just looking for an answer to copy, are more likely to be blown off. 

Besides Google, StackOverflow is home to many of our programming answers, where if we ask, we shall receive (most of the time). However, 
since it's a forum that anyone can just use, you've got the "smart" questions and the "not so smart" questions mixed in there side by 
side. Below are two questions asked on StackOverflow that exhibits an example of a "not smart" question, and a "smart" question.
