We were always told when we were younger that there was never such thing as a "stupid question", and quite frankly, I think 
we all know that statement is false. There is such thing as a "not smart" question, and it's especially notable in the 
realm of programming. Programmers -- regardless of how much experience they have -- will always ask questions, always look for
answers. However, according to Eric Raymond's **["How to Ask Questions"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)**,
the smarter questions get more satisfactory answers.
