# Final Project Idea
Authors: Jianna Orias, Wiley Bui

## Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
Incoming students from the mainland and other places around the world are completely 
new to the UH campus -- and Oahu in general! We want to solve this problem by implementing
a map they can rely on for finding places to do various island activities and local eateries.

## Mockup page ideas
* Landing page
    * has map
* Places page
    * Editable
    * Users can rate
    * Categorize page by: 
        * Rating
        * Radius/Distance from UH
        * Price
* Eateries page (Editable)
    * Categorize page by: 
        * Rating
        * Radius/Distance from UH
        * Price
* Sign up page
* Coupons Page
    * Users can add and upload coupons/discounts
* I'm Feeling Lucky Page
* Contact us

## Use case ideas
* User goes straight to landing page first, can click on the map to see where places are
* Pages are divided by tabs, user can click on either Place Tab, Eatery Tab, 
Discount Tab, or I'm Feeling Lucky!
* If they want to save, edit, or rate a location/eatery, they will be directed to Sign Up page
* If they have a question, comment, or concern, they can be redirected to our Contact Us page

## Beyond the basics
* Google Maps API
* Using MongoDB to save user info
* Notification to subscribed users of discounts and new things
