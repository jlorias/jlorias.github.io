### "Don't write spaghetti code!" 
-----

That quote is one I will never forget even as a senior. Writing code is like writing any
other piece of literature. There's different styles, different verbage... different 
ideas being displayed into a textual representations to represent a whole. Because each 
human being is a unique individual, no two writings will be the same -- and that holds 
true for codes as well.

Don't get me wrong -- individualism is one of the definitions of what makes us human. 
However, in times where we need to bring in all of these individual ideas to fit a common
goal, it's also important that we're all on the same level of communication and vision.
In terms of coding, this is where coding standards come into play as one of the most 
crucial aspects of software development. 

### Structure to a chaos of ideas
-----

When everyone is on the same page, that's as close to harmony as you can get, especially
when working on a team. Coding standards allow a team to type and work the same, even if
they all have different ideas. Having a coding standard lets the team members convey their
ideas in a manner where everyone can understand it relatively easily, rather than having to
do unnecessary explanations. 

On top of that, having a coding standard definitely makes learning how to code much easier.
You recognize patterns, ways of writing code that you get familiarized, get used to doing
things a certain way that it becomes muscle memory. If you search online how to code a 
specific script, you might come across hundreds of different variations. Maybe even get
stuck. Who knows. It's a scary world out there. Let the light of coding standards guide you.

It's difficult working in a team, but it's needed in this field. Teamwork makes the dream work, 
and without teamwork, you simply cannot get things done. Having a coding standard is a 
first step in that direction.
