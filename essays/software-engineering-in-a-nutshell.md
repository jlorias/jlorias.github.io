## A Stepping Stone in My Career
Man, has it been a semester with this class in my schedule. Yet, despite the 
courseload, ICS 314 has been one of the few classes where I strived to do my
very best and learn the concepts. I finally started to see what I wanted to do 
in my career. Considering the fact that I didn't have an answer to "What do you want
o do/be when you graduate from college?" earleir this year, this class has been miraculous
on a lot of aspects of my life.

## The Basics, and then Some
We primarily focused on the design and creation of web applications (which personally was a
blessing for me as it strengthened my desire to pursue this line of career in the future).
Regardless, these web applications gave us the opportunity to learn the foundations of what it's
like in the world of a software engineer or developer. 

### Coding Standards are key
One of the most valuable things software engineering has taught me is that collaboration
and communication is key -- not just in projects, but in life as well. You can't finish a
high-quality product without Coding Standards, which allow you to collaborate with your peers
on the same level of understanding. This uniform level of understanding makes group projects and 
collaborative efforts so much more simpler on your part, and you don't have to stress over thinking 
that your teammate doesn't know what's going on. 

### Open up with Open Source Software Development
Open Source Software Development is also another key in
software engineering, as it allows for easier access to code and inspirations thereof, thus inciting
better collaboration practices with your peers on any project. GitHub, for example, is a perfect example
of Open Source software development. Accessibility is crucial in any group setting, as you
need your peers to be able to access what you're working on and vice versa, creating grounds for 
better brainstorming.

### Agile Project Management is the Honestly The Best
Lastly, even with all the open collaboration and communication, software developers need a plan of action. They
need to set milestones of their goals, allocate the different jobs based on peer preference and skill, manage 
their time wisely and efficiently to produce the highest quality product possible. This is where Agile Methodology
comes in -- it allows you to create achievable goals (i.e. Milestones) for you and your peers to keep track of, driven
by the creation of issues that need to be resolved in order to form the structure and scheduling of your software
engineering project.

Personally, I think this is probably one of the most important things we've learned this entire semester, as it not 
only applies to web development or software engineering alone. At my previous internship at Caesars, the team I worked
with also used Agile Methodology, and they were an eCommerce design/production team (who also worked closely with developers).
This method of project management is a perfect way to assign and keep track of issues that need to be done, rank the most
important issues, keep track of milestones to see how you're progressing -- overall, Agile Project Management keeps your 
project running smoothly and effectively. 

### Together, You Can Be The Very Best
With this being the very last essay of the semester (for ICS 314), I can proudly say that this has been one of my 
favorite classes to take. You learn so much, not just about technical skills, but also a lot about the "soft" skills 
that really define you as a better *soft*ware engineer. The skills and concepts I learned are things I can easily 
apply to outside of the class -- in other classes, future jobs, and really in all aspects of my upcoming life.
